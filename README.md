Your Reflection and Analysis
Instructions: Complete the reflection below by editing this markdown cell.

My Understanding of Machine Learning Types
Supervised Learning: [dataset already labeled, example photos of dog labeled dog, computer will learn from theses examples if the animal is or not a dog]

Unsupervised Learning: [analyse is made by a set of samples without previous labeled. examplo, would analyse a group of photos and provide information about quality of the photo, shape.]

Reinforcement Learning: [learning by rewarding , examplo game. if correct gain point , eventually computer will find better strategy to not lose point]

My Analysis of the Wine Classification Project
Best performing model: [Logistic Regression]
Why do you think this model performed better?: [Logistic Regression works well with linearly separable data, which appears to be the case here]
What would you try next to improve performance?: [collect more data]
Real-World Application Ideas
Industry of Interest: [Medical]
ML Problem: [Cancer Disease Diagnosis and Early Detection thorugh radiology image]
Type of ML: [Supervised and Unsupervised]
Data Needed: [age, sex, type of blood, Pre-existing conditions, tumor location, size, shape, texture, smoke, alcohol]
Key Learnings
Most important concept learned: [Understanding the data and choosing the right features is often more important than choosing the most complex model.]

Most challenging part: [evaluation was the most challenged]

Questions for further exploration: [How can we explain the model's predictions to non-technical stakeholders]
