Your Reflection and Analysis
Instructions: Complete the reflection below by editing this markdown cell.

My Understanding of Machine Learning Types
Supervised Learning: [dataset already labeled, example photos of dog labeled dog, computer will learn from theses examples if the animal is or not a dog]

Unsupervised Learning: [analyse is made by a set of samples without previous labeled. examplo, would analyse a group of photos and provide information about quality of the photo, shape.]

Reinforcement Learning: [learning by rewarding , examplo game. if correct gain point , eventually computer will find better strategy to not lose point]

My Analysis of the Wine Classification Project
Best performing model: [Logistic Regression]

Why do you think this model performed better?: [Logistic Regression works well with linearly separable data, which appears to be the case here]

What would you try next to improve performance?: [collect more data]

Real-World Application Ideas
Industry of Interest: [Medical]

ML Problem: [Cancer Disease Diagnosis and Early Detection thorugh radiology image]

Type of ML: [Supervised and Unsupervised]

Data Needed: [age, sex, type of blood, Pre-existing conditions, tumor location, size, shape, texture, smoke, alcohol]

Key Learnings
Most important concept learned: [Understanding the data and choosing the right features is often more important than choosing the most complex model.]

Most challenging part: [evaluation was the most challenged]

Questions for further exploration: [How can we explain the model's predictions to non-technical stakeholders]

### My Understanding of Machine Learning Types
**Supervised Learning**: computer is trained and taught what is correct.

**Unsupervised Learning**: computer finds relationships between data with no training or input data.

**Reinforcement Learning**: computer learns itself by trials with penalties and rewards to gain experience.
### My Analysis of the Wine Classification Project

**Best performing model**: Random Forest

**Why do you think this model performed better?**: It can use multiple factors like alcohol, malic acid, ash, etc. to and combine decision paths to classify wine accurately.

**What would you try next to improve performance?**: Dimensionally remove to reduce noise.

### Real-World Application Ideas

**Industry of Interest**: Customer service

**ML Problem**: understands the expectation of customers and categorizes it to deal with.

**Type of ML**: Unsupervized learning

**Data Needed**: age, locations, behaviors, shopping frequency, feedback.

### Key Learnings

**Most important concept learned**: Understand and use appropriately the type of Machine Learning.

**Most challenging part**: Deploy the ML model to an specific case.

**Questions for further exploration**: How can we clean and preprocess unstructured data?
