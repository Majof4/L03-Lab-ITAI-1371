### My Understanding of Machine Learning Types
**Supervised Learning**: computer is trained and taught what is correct.

**Unsupervised Learning**: computer finds relationships between data with no training or input data.

**Reinforcement Learning**: computer learns itself by trials with penalties and rewards to gain experience.
### My Analysis of the Wine Classification Project

**Best performing model**: Random Forest

**Why do you think this model performed better?**: It can use multiple factors like alcohol, malic acid, ash, etc. to and combine decision paths to classify wine accurately.

**What would you try next to improve performance?**: Dimensionally remove to reduce noise.

### Real-World Application Ideas

**Industry of Interest**: Customer service

**ML Problem**: understands the expectation of customers and categorizes it to deal with.

**Type of ML**: Unsupervized learning

**Data Needed**: age, locations, behaviors, shopping frequency, feedback.

### Key Learnings

**Most important concept learned**: Understand and use appropriately the type of Machine Learning.

**Most challenging part**: Deploy the ML model to an specific case.

**Questions for further exploration**: How can we clean and preprocess unstructured data?

My Understanding of Machine Learning Types
Supervised Learning: The type of machine learning that involves a labeled data set input for model training.

Unsupervised Learning: The tyoe of machine learning that involves an unlabeled data set input for model training.

Reinforcement Learning: The method used in this excersise that involves reward/punishment for each time the machine iterates through the training data. This model rewards the machine when it yeilds a correct reuslt while alos issuing a punishment for an incorrect one.

My Analysis of the Wine Classification Project
Best performing model: Logistic Regression

Why do you think this model performed better?: Since our data consists of regression (decimal) data, we ustilized the correct model.

What would you try next to improve performance?: Increase the number of training iterations.

Real-World Application Ideas
Industry of Interest: Architectrual design - land development

ML Problem: Machine learning could recognize land sizes and the various setbacks that are given to calculate/predict the number of single-family residential lots that can be created after subdividing the property.

Type of ML: Reinforcement learning and supervised learning

Data Needed: local zoning and development codes, land dimensions, total acreage, type of streets, setbacks from deed restrcitions.

Key Learnings
Most important concept learned: ML workflow.

Most challenging part: Model peformance evaluaiton and selecting the correct machine learning type for the job.

Questions for further exploration: What is the best criteria to follow to decide on the which model type fits best?
